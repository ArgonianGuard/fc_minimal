# Fortress Connected Minimal
Fortress Connected Minimal is the same code base as Fortress Connected, but minimized to the greatest extent to reduce load times and extra content.

FC is a *heavily* modified version of Lambda Fortress: Extended to have more features, fixes, and support

### To run the game, you *must* have these installed:
	Source SDK Base 2013 Multiplayer SET TO BETA: "previous2021"
	Team Fortress 2
	Half-Life 2
	If you wish to play with Portal or Half-Life Source content, you must also have those installed.
### Source SDK Base 2013 Multiplayer **MUST** be set to "previous2021" in **PROPERTIES** > **BETAS** > **DOWN ARROW** > SELECT "previous2021"
Do not opt-in to any betas for Half-Life 2, this mod was designed to work with the current latest HL2 Anniversary update.

### Installation:
Method 1:
Download by GitHub Desktop and clone in to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\fc_minimal" It is recommended to use GitHub Desktop or TortoiseGit so when you need to update, you can just press "Pull" without having to re-download the whole repo.

Method 2:
Download from the releases and extract to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods" and *make sure* that the directory is named "fc_minimal"

Method 3:
Download by clicking the green "Code" button at the top and press "Download ZIP". Once it is done downloading, open the archive and extract "fc_minimal-main" to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods"
*Then make sure that you rename the directory to "fc_minimal"* **NOT** "fc_minimal-main" or you will not be able to launch the game.

### Fixes including:
- Weapon improvements
- UI improvements
- Map improvements
- Episodic tweaks
- Full Bot support and MvM
- Multi-Seat vehicles
- Save/Restore system
